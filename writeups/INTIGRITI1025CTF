# Intigriti Challenge 1025 — SSRF Writeup (sanitized)

**Date:** Oct 15, 2025  
**Duration:** ~5 days  
**Status:** Accepted by Intigriti (unintended solution)  

## TL;DR
Discovered SSRF on `challenge.php?url=...`, enumerated internal services via Apache *mod_status*, located upload endpoint. Although the intended POST-based upload chain was not fully achieved by me, I retrieved the challenge flag via an unintended shell left by another researcher and submitted a full report accepted by Intigriti.

## Key skills/tools
Burp Suite, ffuf, curl, PHP, gopher encoding, multipart/form-data, proc_open

## Lessons & notes
- Always check internal VHost IPs exposed in server-status.
- Upload bypasses may require magic bytes + filename tricks.
- Responsible disclosure: all testing done in CTF environment.

*(Artifacts are sanitized — flags and exact internal IPs are redacted.)*
